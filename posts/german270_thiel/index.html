  "articleBody": " The current historical moment appears to be marked by opposition to globalization, which has emerged in many countries in the various forms of populism, restrictive trade policies, attacks on “neo-liberalism,” protest parties and localism. These positions are sometimes accompanied by appeals to national interests and cultural traditions. This new mood is viewed as a break with a previous paradigm of international institutions and “world citizenship.”\nThis seminar proceeds from this contemporary reassertion of state sovereignty against market processes and internationalist claims in order to inquire into the historical, theoretical and cultural roots of the problem. Has the process of globalization stalled? What are the implications for the state and its aspiration for sovereignty? And how does technology, which contributed so much to the process of globalization, fit into this picture, especially in the guise of new technologies? This seminar therefore explores the tensions between state and market, their cultural contexts, technological innovation, and the importance of community belonging.\n1. Globalization: Prophecy versus History Francis Fukuyama, “The End of History?” in The National Interest (1989) ~25pp\rKishore Mahbubani, Has the West Lost It? (2018) ~90pp\rStephen R. Platt, \"How Britain's First Mission to China Went Wrong\" (2018) ~5 pp\rNorman Angell, title chapter from The Great Illusion (first published 1909; fourth American edition 1913) ~25pp\r In the summer of 1989, just as tanks rolled through Tiananmen Square, but just before the Berlin Wall fell, American political scientist Francis Fukuyama declared the “end of history”: different countries might take more or less time to get there, but the inevitable destination for everyone would be liberal democracy. Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani reviews the historical record of American leadership during this time of faith in globalization: a failed war in Iraq, a disastrous financial crisis, and a top trading partner that just declared its leader president for life. Were prophecies of success related to this history of failure? Norman Angell’s Great Illusion (fourth American edition published in 1913) and historian Stephen Platt’s vignette of China before the Opium War introduce two other moments, one and two centuries ago, when leaders believed that global commerce would bring about peace and unity.\n2. Universalism: From the Tower of Babel to the Last Things Genesis 11:1-9 (The Tower of Babel) ~1p\rKarl Löwith, Meaning in History (1949) pp iv-207 ~210pp\rRevelation 17 (Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots) ~1p\r Would anybody ever have believed in a single destiny for the whole world without first having believed in a single deity? Philosopher Karl Löwith’s Meaning in History gives an answer while it reviews all the ways the West has understood history’s meaning, from the Bible to Kant and Marx.\n3. From 1914 to 1949: World War Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political (1928; 1932 edition) ~100pp\rCarl Schmitt, Land and Sea (1940) ~100pp\rAlain de Benoist, \"Nazism and Communism: Evil Twins?\"(1998) ~19pp\r Carl Schmitt rebuts universal empire with a vision of friends versus enemies. Alain de Benoist suggests that even the most extreme enemies may come to resemble each other. How does a geopolitical reading of land and sea powers map onto questions of globalization, culture, and community?\n4. The 1950s: Toward a world state? Alexandre Kojève, Tyranny and Wisdom (1950) in On Tyranny ~40pp\rLeo Strauss, “Restatement on Xenophon’s Hiero” (1959) in On Tyranny ~40pp*\r Why not have a world government? If there is a single rational way to rule, why shouldn’t rationality rule the world? Progressive Russian-French emigré Alexandre Kojève, who helped lay the groundwork for the European Union, engages conservative German-American emigré Leo Strauss in a classic debate about the “universal and homogenous state.”\n5. From the ‘60s to the ‘10s: Optimism to Stagnation Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, The American Challenge (1967) pp 2-50 ~48pp\rRobert Gordon, \"Is U.S. Economic Growth Over?\" (2012) ~21pp\rJohn Horgan, \"Why I Think Science Is Ending\" (1997) ~10pp\rM. Teitelbaum, \"The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage\" (2014) ~5pp\rChristopher Lasch, The Revolt of the Elites (1996) pp 3-79; pp 161-175 ~90pp Vaclav Smil, \"Can Trump bring manufacturing jobs back?\" (2017) ~2pp\r Proponents of progress promise(d) economic growth and technological innovation. Yet authors this week suggest that progress may have been oversold. Journalist Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber in 1967 warned his fellow Europeans of coming eclipse as a result of accelerating economic and technological progress in America. But economist Robert Gordon, looking back from 2012, reviews an actual record of economic and technological stagnation. John Horgan argues that pure science, too, has reached a plateau. Michael Teitelbaum suggests that alarmism about a shortage of scientists has perversely made science a less attractive career. The gap between the mirage of progress and the reality of stagnation—experienced unequally across the social spectrum—has had cultural and political consequences, as described by Christopher Lasch. Vaclav Smil raises a politically relevant point about the unique importance of manufacturing.\n6. Varieties of Universalism and Cosmopolitanism Ingeborg Bachmann, \"Three Paths to the Lake\" (1972) ~95pp\rBenedict XVI, the Regensburg Lecture (2006) ~20pp\rBarack Obama, the Cairo Speech (2009) ~13pp\rK. A. Appiah, “There is No Such Thing as Western Civilization” (2016) ~10pp\rJ. D. Davidson \u0026 Lord William Rees-Mogg, \"Transcending Locality\" (1997) ~29pp\rKai-fu Lee, AI Superpowers (2018) ~100pp excerpt TBD\r Austrian author Ingeborg Bachmann’s story explores the subjective experience of a cosmopolitan life, amid questions of empire and the authenticity of provincial localism. Benedict XVI and Barack Obama both address Islam, one from the point of view of rationalist Catholic universalism, the other from the point of view of liberal humanitarian universalism. K. A. Appiah argues for cosmopolitanism and against ideas of Western uniqueness. But if, as he claims, there is “no such thing as Western Civilization,” would he also claim that there is no East Asian civilization? No Islamic civilization? Is civilization antithetical to any local specification? James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg could be said to herald a different kind of cosmopolitanism, one based on the separation of money from government. Their view of technology transcending politics raises the question of cryptocurrency: is this the ultimate challenge to state sovereignty? At the opposite end of information technology, Kai-fu Lee predicts that the implementation of Artificial Intelligence will be the key to China’s coming economic dominance.\n7. The Future of World Order Yoram Hazony, The Virtue of Nationalism (2018) ~234 pp\rLiu Mingfu, \"The Chinese Dream to Overtake America\"(2015) ~5pp\r Garden variety progressivism stereotypically denounces empire and imperialism, but what is the opposite of empire? Yoram Hazony says it is nationalism, for which he offers a sustained defense. Former PLA officer Liu Mingfu speaks for one particularly strong strain of contemporary nationalism.\n8. Actually existing globalization: Corruption on the periphery Sarah Chayes, Thieves of State (2015) ~200pp\rRory Stewart, \"The Irresistible Illusion\" in London Review of Books (2009) ~9pp\r Based on long experience in US-occupied Afghanistan, Sarah Chayes argues that corruption fuels violence. But who will take responsibility for ridding the world of corruption, and how could it be done? Rory Stewart contrasts the realism of 19th century British imperialists with the abstraction and impracticality of contemporary bureaucrats. This week looks at what has actually happened where Western force has been used to spread democracy.\n9. Actually existing globalization: Consumption in the metropole Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, \"Conspicuous consumption is over\" (2017) ~2pp\rAmy Chua, \"Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior\" (2011) ~5pp\rTom Wright \u0026 Bradley Hope, \"The Billion-Dollar Mystery Man and the Wildest Party Vegas Ever Saw\" (2018) ~10pp\rRené Girard, “Triangular Desire,” from Deceit, Desire, and the Novel (1961) ~50pp\rGeoffrey West, \"Toward a Science of Cities,\" from Scale (2017) ~65pp\r Is there any future outside of big cities? What are big cities for, anyway? This week turns to questions of imitation and rivalry on a global scale, especially as intensified within and diffused from metropoles like London and New York. Elizabeth Currid-Halkett describes the consumption habits of the upper middle class; Amy Chua describes the methods of child rearing intended to get kids into that class. Tom Wright and Bradley Hope’s reporting on the man who stole $7 billion USD from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund combines imitative consumption with the previous week’s theme of corruption. René Girard contributes a theory of imitative desire; Geoffrey West outlines a theory of cities. Is the concentration of talent in a small handful of cities irreversible?\n10. Antichrist and Apocalypse René Girard, “Hamlet’s Dull Revenge,” from Theater of Envy (1991) ~19pp\rVladimir Solovyov, War, Progress, and the End of History (1900) ~180pp\r What was Hamlet waiting for? René Girard reinterprets this classic avatar of Western man: in an age when technology has made it possible to destroy the world, perhaps we should understand hesitation before vengeance. Vladimir Solovyov looks forward from 1900 to a speculative end of history, including intercontinental war and an Anti-Christ preaching universal harmony. What did he get right? What does the end of history look like to us today?\nClean Up: Books to purchase (multiple chapters assigned). These will be ordered at the bookstore and will be placed on reserve in Green Library.

<p>The current historical moment appears to be marked by opposition to globalization, which has emerged in many countries
in the various forms of populism, restrictive trade policies, attacks on “neo-liberalism,” protest parties and localism. These positions
are sometimes accompanied by appeals to national interests and cultural traditions. This new mood is viewed as a break with a
previous paradigm of international institutions and “world citizenship.”</p>
<p>This seminar proceeds from this contemporary reassertion of state sovereignty against market processes and internationalist claims in order to inquire into the historical, theoretical and cultural roots of the problem. Has the process of globalization stalled? What are the implications for the state and its aspiration
for sovereignty? And how does technology, which contributed so much to the process of globalization, fit into this picture,
especially in the guise of new technologies? This seminar therefore explores the tensions between state and market, their cultural contexts, technological innovation, and the importance of community belonging.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1989, just as tanks rolled through Tiananmen
Square, but just before the Berlin Wall fell, American political scientist Francis Fukuyama declared the &ldquo;end of history&rdquo;: different
countries might take more or less time to get there, but the
inevitable destination for everyone would be liberal democracy.
Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani reviews the historical
record of American leadership during this time of faith in
globalization: a failed war in Iraq, a disastrous financial crisis, and
a top trading partner that just declared its leader president for
life. Were prophecies of success related to this history of failure?
Norman Angell&rsquo;s Great Illusion (fourth American edition published
in 1913) and historian Stephen Platt&rsquo;s vignette of China before the
Opium War introduce two other moments, one and two centuries
ago, when leaders believed that global commerce would bring
about peace and unity.</p>

<p>Proponents of progress promise(d) economic growth and
technological innovation. Yet authors this week suggest that
progress may have been oversold. Journalist Jean-Jacques
Servan-Schreiber in 1967 warned his fellow Europeans of coming
eclipse as a result of accelerating economic and technological
progress in America. But economist Robert Gordon, looking back
from 2012, reviews an actual record of economic and
technological stagnation. John Horgan argues that pure science,
too, has reached a plateau. Michael Teitelbaum suggests that
alarmism about a shortage of scientists has perversely made
science a less attractive career. The gap between the mirage of
progress and the reality of stagnation—experienced unequally
across the social spectrum—has had cultural and political
consequences, as described by Christopher Lasch. Vaclav Smil
raises a politically relevant point about the unique importance of
manufacturing.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Austrian author Ingeborg Bachmann&rsquo;s story explores the
subjective experience of a cosmopolitan life, amid questions of
empire and the authenticity of provincial localism. Benedict XVI
and Barack Obama both address Islam, one from the point of view
of rationalist Catholic universalism, the other from the point of
view of liberal humanitarian universalism. K. A. Appiah argues for
cosmopolitanism and against ideas of Western uniqueness. But if,
as he claims, there is “no such thing as Western Civilization,”
would he also claim that there is no East Asian civilization? No
Islamic civilization? Is civilization antithetical to any local
specification? James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg
could be said to herald a different kind of cosmopolitanism, one
based on the separation of money from government. Their view of
technology transcending politics raises the question of
cryptocurrency: is this the ultimate challenge to state
sovereignty? At the opposite end of information technology, Kai-fu
Lee predicts that the implementation of Artificial Intelligence will
be the key to China&rsquo;s coming economic dominance.</p>

Chayes argues that corruption fuels violence. But who will take
responsibility for ridding the world of corruption, and how could it
be done? Rory Stewart contrasts the realism of 19th century
British imperialists with the abstraction and impracticality of
contemporary bureaucrats. This week looks at what has actually
happened where Western force has been used to spread
democracy.</p>

<p>Is there any future outside of big cities? What are big cities for,
anyway? This week turns to questions of imitation and rivalry on a
global scale, especially as intensified within and diffused from
metropoles like London and New York. Elizabeth Currid-Halkett
describes the consumption habits of the upper middle class; Amy
Chua describes the methods of child rearing intended to get kids
into that class. Tom Wright and Bradley Hope&rsquo;s reporting on the
man who stole $7 billion USD from the 1MDB sovereign wealth
fund combines imitative consumption with the previous week&rsquo;s
theme of corruption. René Girard contributes a theory of imitative
desire; Geoffrey West outlines a theory of cities. Is the
concentration of talent in a small handful of cities irreversible?</p>

<p>What was Hamlet waiting for? René Girard reinterprets this classic
avatar of Western man: in an age when technology has made it
possible to destroy the world, perhaps we should understand
hesitation before vengeance. Vladimir Solovyov looks forward
from 1900 to a speculative end of history, including
intercontinental war and an Anti-Christ preaching universal
harmony. What did he get right? What does the end of history look
like to us today?</p>
